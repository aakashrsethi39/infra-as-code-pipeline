# 🚀 Infrastructure as Code CI/CD Pipeline on AWS using Terraform, Docker, ECS Fargate & GitHub Actions

## 📌 Project Overview

This project automates the deployment of a containerized web application on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and CI/CD (GitHub Actions).

The goal is to eliminate manual production deployments and create a secure, scalable, repeatable deployment pipeline.

---

# 📖 Business Scenario

A growing e-commerce company was deploying applications manually using SSH.

Problems:

- Manual deployments
- Human error
- Configuration mistake
- Production outages
- No rollback capability

The CTO requested:

- No manual production deployments
- Fully automated infrastructure
- Automated application deployment
- Rollback capability
- Infrastructure stored as code

This project solves that problem.

# ⚙ Phase 1 – Application

Created a responsive frontend using:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

The page simulates a deployment dashboard containing:

- Pipeline Status
- Deploy Button
- Deployment Logs

---

# ⚙ Phase 2 – Docker

Containerized the application.

Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine

COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
```

Build

```bash
docker build -t ecommerce-app .
```

Run

```bash
docker run -p 8081:80 ecommerce-app
```

---

# ⚙ Phase 3 – Push Docker Image to Amazon ECR

Created Amazon ECR Repository.

Login

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password \
| docker login \
--username AWS \
--password-stdin \
<ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
```

Tag

```bash
docker tag ecommerce-app:latest \
ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/ecommerce-app:latest
```

Push

```bash
docker push ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/ecommerce-app:latest
```
